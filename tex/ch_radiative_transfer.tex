\startsection[title=Atmospheric Extinction]

    Neglecting scattering. Existing absorption models.

    \startsubsection[title=Gaseous Absorption]

        Molecule transitions. Oxygen, Water vapor. What about nitrogen or CO2?
        Included in Liebe Model or negligible? I think Hewison had nitrogen as
        well.

\startsection[title=Representation of the Atmospheric State]

    Discretization in the vertical, selecting state vector variables:
    compromise between dimensionality and information content (including
    forward model needs).

    \startsubsection[title=The Choice of State Vector Variables]

        Combining water vapor and LWC into \math{\mathrm{log}(q_{tot})} to
        reduce dimensionality, enforce positivity and better error
        characteristics.

    \startsubsection[title=Vertical Discretization and Interpolation]

        Smoothing. Compromise between resolution necessary for numerical model
        and actual information content. Inclusion of upper atmosphere or not.

        Custom implementation of Liebe gas absorption, Turner et al. cloud
        absorption.
