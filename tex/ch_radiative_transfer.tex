\startsection[title=The Radiative Transfer Equation]

    General form, absorption only, Rayleigh-Jeans â†’ Brightness Temperatures.
    Discretization.

    Differential form of RTE without scattering

    \startformula
        \DERIV{I_\nu}{s} = - I_\nu \ABSCOEF + F \EQCOMMA
    \stopformula

    where $I_\nu$ is spectral radiance (power per frequency and solid angle in
    a specific direction), $\ABSCOEF$ is the absorption coefficient of the medium
    ($0 \lt \ABSCOEF \lt 1$), $F$ is a source term and $s$ is distance in beam
    direction.

    The only source term considered here is emission according to Planck's law

    \startformula
        F = \epsilon B_\nu(T) \EQCOMMA
    \stopformula

    where $\epsilon$ is the emission coefficient of the radiating medium
    describing its difference to an ideal black body ($0 \lt \epsilon \lt 1$)
    and $B_\nu(T)$ is the Planck function giving the emitted spectral radiance
    of a black body. Under the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium the
    absorption and emission coefficients are equal (Kirchhoff's law).
    Substitute into RTE (REFERENCE) to obtain

    \startformula
        \DERIV{I_\nu}{s} = - \ABSCOEF(I_\nu - B_\nu(T)) \EQSTOP
    \stopformula

    For temperatures occuring in the atmosphere the Planck function in the
    microwave region is represented well by the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation
    which relates the spectral radiance at a given frequency linearly to
    temperature

    \startformula
        B_\nu(T) \approx \frac{2 \nu^2 k T}{c^2} \EQSTOP
    \stopformula

    By expressing the spectral radiance $I_\nu$ with the concept of brightness
    temperature $\BT$ (which is the temperature a blackbody would have to have
    in order to reproduce the emission by a grey body) and the Rayleigh-Jeans
    approximation, the radiative transfer equation can be expressed exclusively
    in terms of temperatures:

    \startformula
        \DERIV{\BT}{s} = - \ABSCOEF (\BT - T) \EQSTOP
    \stopformula

    \startsubsection[title={A Solution for Radiometer Applications}]

        Assumption of horizontally homogeneous atmosphere, relate distance
        towards radiometer $s$ to height above radiometer $z$

        \startformula
            \DERIV{s}{z} = - \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)} \EQCOMMA
        \stopformula

        where the azimuth angle $\theta$ is defined as the deviation from
        zenith.  Because height increases with height but radiation arriving at
        the radiometer is downwelling, the sign of the derivative is negative.

        In order to solve the radiative transfer equation after the coordinate
        transformation, optical depth $\OD$ is introduced

        \startformula
        \startalign[n=3,align={left,right,left}]
            \NC \NC \OD(s) = \NC \int_{s_0}^{s} \ABSCOEF(u) \diff u \NR
            \NC \Rightarrow~ \NC \OD(z) = \NC
                - \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)} \int_{z_0}^{z} \ABSCOEF(u) \diff u \NR
            \NC \Rightarrow~ \NC \DERIV{\OD}{z} = \NC
                - \frac{\ABSCOEF}{\cos(\theta)} \EQCOMMA \NR
        \stopalign
        \stopformula

        and REFERENCE is multiplied on both sides by $e^{\OD}$ and
        rearranged, yielding

        \startformula
            \DERIV{\BT}{z} e^\OD + \frac{\ABSCOEF \BT e^\OD}{\cos(\theta)}
            = \DERIV{(\BT e^\OD)}{z}
            = - \frac{\ABSCOEF T e^\OD}{\cos(\theta)} \EQSTOP
        \stopformula

        Integrating this from the surface ($z = 0$) to space ($z = \infty$)
        gives an expression for the brightness temperature measured by the
        radiometer $\BT(0)$:

        \startformula
            \BT(0) = \BT(\infty) e^{\OD(\infty)} + \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)}
                \int_{0}^{\infty} \ABSCOEF(z) T(z) e^{\OD(z)} \diff z \EQSTOP
        \stopformula

        $T_B(\infty)$ is given by the cosmic background, the absorption
        coefficient can be determined from the atmospheric profile (see
        section REFERENCE).
