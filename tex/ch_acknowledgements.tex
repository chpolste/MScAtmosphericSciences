I want to thank Mathias for giving me the freedom to take this research
wherever I wanted it to go. Even though I reinvented the wheel a couple of
times along the way and many of my ideas did not work out as I hoped, this
freedom allowed me to learn a lot.

I am grateful to Reto, Szabo and Christian for providing the data I needed for
my research.

Thank you to the developers of numpy, scipy and the ridiculously awesome pandas
library as well as everyone answering questions on stackoverflow. Because of
you, programming and data analysis is a much less frustrating experience.

Thank you to everyone involved in the making of 30 Rock. You were the cause of
many delays but kept me well entertained during the writing of this thesis.

Anna and Alex, thank you for enduring my hour-long rants about programming
languages and other things you probably did not remotely care about as much as
I did and for our fun and interesting discussions about science, life
and TV.

Words can barely express my appreciation for everything my parents have done
for me since I was born. Mom and dad, you have always supported me and helped
me become the person I am today. There is nothing greater I could have wished
for.
