Started research on topic while funded by ... Whoever provided Nordkette data.
Reto, Szabo, Christian for data used in this thesis.

Mathias for giving me the freedom to shape take this research wherever
I wanted. Even though many of my ideas did not work as I hoped, this freedom
resulted in me learning a lot, more than I would have within a restricted
topic.

Alex, Anna for enduring my hour-long rants about programming and for our
discussions about life and TV.

Ari, Fabian, Tim? 30 Rock crew for keeping me entertained? Thank you to the
developers of numpy, scipy and the ridiculously awesome pandas library as well
as everyone answering questions on stackoverflow. You have saved so much time
of my life.

My family, especially my parents, for everything and their support in the past,
present and future.
