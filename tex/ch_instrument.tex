The discussed optimal estimation and linear regression methods are applied
to retrievals of temperature and humidity profiles based on data collected
in Innsbruck. A radiosonde climatology provides reference profiles for
the evaluation of synthetic performance of the retrieval techniques based
on simulated brightness temperatures and for an application to actual
radiometer data. Additional prior information is obtained from vertical
profiles forcasted by a numerical weather prediction model. Figure
\in[fig:map_ibk] gives an overview of the Innsbruck region and the locations of
all data sources.

\startsection[title={Radiosonde Climatology},reference=ch:rasoclim]

    Radiosondes are launched regularly once per day from Innsbruck airport
    at the location of marker 1 in Figure \in[fig:map_ibk]. Launch time is
    usually between 01:00 and 04:00 UTC, which corresponds to 02:00 to 05:00
    local time in winter and 03:00 to 06:00 local time during daylight saving
    time. Here, the climatological dataset of temperature, humidity and
    pressure spanning the years 1999 to 2005 and 2009 to 2012, previously used
    by \cite[Massaro2013] and \cite[Meyer2016], is extended with profiles
    obtained between 2013 and 2016.  In total, data from 3561 radiosonde are
    available which are separated into a training data set of 3296 profiles and
    a test data set of 265 profiles which contains all data between February
    2015 and January 2016. This partitioning results in the largest overlap of
    test data with other data sources.

    Because liquid water content is not measured by any instrument during
    a balloon sounding, cloud water content is calculated by the empirical
    cloud model of \cite[Karstens1994] based on humidity and temperature
    information. This model is frequently used for microwave radiometer
    retrieval studies, e.g. by \cite[Lohnert2012,Martinet2015].

    The profiles of pressure, temperature, humidity and liquid water content
    are linearly interpolated to the 50 levels of the retrieval grid. Figure
    \in[fig:raso_prior] shows the climatology's mean profile of temperature and
    total water content together with intervals of ±1 and ±2 standard
    deviation. Temperature variability is almost constant throughout the
    troposphere, while water variability is greater near the surface and
    vanishes at the mean height of the tropopause. The latter is due to the
    small water vapor content in the upper atmosphere. Total water content
    uncertainty intervals are asymmetric because the underlying distribution is
    a Gaussian in logarithmic space (see section \in[ch:statevector]).

    Whenever the accuracy of a retrieval method is evaluated in subsequent
    sections, these radiosonde data are the reference that retrieved profiles
    are compared to. It must be noted that radiosondes provide point
    measurements, are affected by horizontal drift and take a substantial amout
    of time to reach their final height. These properties of balloon-bourne
    sensors raise concerns regarding the representativity of the measured
    vertical profiles for a fixed location. Also, only 4 \% of all radiosonde
    profiles were obtained during day time which has to be condsidered when
    assessing the applicability of retrieval methods based on the climatology.
    Inaccuracies due to these issues are however tolerated due to the lack of
    a better alternative.

\startsection[title=COSMO-7 Simulated Soundings]

    COSMO-7 is a regional weather prediction model for western and central
    Europe operated by MeteoSwiss. Its terrain-following grid has a
    horizontal mesh size of 6.6 km and 60 vertical levels up to 21453
    m altitude. Vertical profiles of temperature, humidity and cloud water
    content for a gridpoint near Innsbruck (marker 3 in Figure
    \in[fig:map_ibk]) have been obtained for the timespan 2015-02-06 to
    2016-01-20 from forecasts initiated at 00 UTC. Liquid water content
    $\QLIQ$ is extracted from the total cloud water content $\QCLOUD$ based on
    the temperature $T$ of the cloud according to

    \startformula
        \QLIQ = \QCLOUD \startcases
            \NC 0 \MC 233.15 \, \KELVIN \le \TEMP \NR
            \NC \frac{\TEMP - 233.15 \, \KELVIN}{40 \, \KELVIN}
                \MC 233.15 \, \KELVIN \lt \TEMP \lt 273.15 \, \KELVIN \EQSTOP \NR
            \NC 1 \MC 273.15 \, \KELVIN \le \TEMP \NR
        \stopcases
    \stopformula

    Forecasts are availabe 6 h steps and up to +30 h. Profiles are linearly
    interpolated to match any given time of retrieval between two lead times.

    Because the ground at the gridpoint near Innsbruck is located on the model
    grid more than 400 m too high at an altitude of 1093 m, the COSMO-7
    profiles have to be extrapolated to the true ground height. At first it was
    considered to simply connect the lowest level of the COSMO-7 profile to
    actual surface measurements of temperature and humidity. This however
    disregards information from the boundary layer processes resolved by the
    model which would then be elevated features. Instead, profiles are
    stretched to the ground by replacing the original height grid of COSMO-7
    by one that ends at the same altitude but starts at the true surface.
    The new grid is chosen such that lower levels are streched more than
    upper levels but the overall relative spacing of the model levels is
    approximately preserved. Because this procedure does not take temperature
    gradients into account the resulting profiles likely have a significant
    bias relative to the true atmospheric state. To counter this, the mean
    bias of the model profiles with respect to the radiosondes from Innsbruck
    airport is removed from the dataset. Because there are only 253 times
    where a radiosounding exists parallel to a COSMO-7 forecast this bias is
    determined from the entire data set. An important implication of this
    choice is that COSMO-7 profiles used for the retrieval are not independent
    of the radiosonde reference data set. This inconvenience is accepted in
    favor of a more robust bias determination based on a larger data set.

    In order to use the COSMO-7 forecasts as a prior for optimal estimation
    retrievals a covariance matrix quantifying the model's uncertainty must
    be known. As for the bias, this matrix is calculated from a comparison
    with the reference radiosonde profiles. Figure \in[fig:cosmo7_prior]
    shows the uncertainty range of a model profile attached to a forecast
    interpolated to 2015-09-11 03:48 UTC in the lower half of the troposphere.
    Temperature uncertainty is highest in the lower troposphere, but smaller
    outside the boundary layer. Uncertainty increases above 6 km only in the
    tropopause region. The water content uncertainty is approximately constant
    up to 5 km above which it is decrasing toward zero. The example profile
    shows that COSMO-7 is able to simulate temperature inversions in the lower
    atmosphere.

\startsection[title=HATPRO Observations,reference=ch:hatpro]

    The Institute of Atmospheric and Cryospheric Sciences at the University of
    Innsbruck operates a passive microwave radiometer on the roof of one of the
    university's buildings as part of the Innsbruck Box project. The instrument
    is a Humidity and Temperature Profiler (HATPRO), built by the Radiometer
    Physics GmbH \cite[authoryears][Rose2005]. It obtains brightness
    temperatures at 14 channels with a resolution of 1 s. The receiver antenna
    can be rotated to allow elevation scanning. Additionally, HATPRO measures
    environmental pressure, temperature and humidity.

    Distance airport to university is approximately 2.5 km.
    Radiosond launches 577 m.

    measurements are not independent of referenc data anymore but else too
    little data are available. In operational applications one might do rolling
