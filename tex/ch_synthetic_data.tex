\startsection[title=Comparison of Retrievals and Radiosoundings]

    Apply linear regression, neural network and 1D-VAR to radiosounding test
    dataset. Play around with additional profile information. Compare
    retrieval performance in boundary layer with using just slope measurements
    (with regression and Bayesian technique).

\startsection[title=An Idealized Experiment with Time-Continuous Retrieval]

    Generate idealized boundary layer evolution, see if inversion displacement
    works. Check how information are propagated into upper atmosphere and
    discuss inclusion of additional model information to better represent upper
    atmosphere â†’ real data evaluation.

    Problems: break of continuity in rain.
