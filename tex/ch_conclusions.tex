    How to improve results.

    Bias correction, better priors, model development, additional profile
    information (e.g. TODO: Height attribution of clouds in the valley is
    possible without ceilometers or cloud radar due to terrain markers.), idea
    and challenges of continuous retrieval

    Radiosondes debated as being "truth" due to problems with measurement
    errors, drift (important for higher altitudes \cite[Crewell2007] and short
    term temporal variations \cite[Gueldner2001,Guledner2013,Tan2011].

    RMS as measure of error not generally comparable. Hong Kong has high
    humidity all year so rms is naturally higher \cite[Tan2011].

    It is probably easier to use ARTS or the hopefully soon to be released
    RTTOV-gb instead of fixing all issues with the MWRTM prototype. This will
    also increase confidence in the results and benefit comparability to other
    studies using the same models.
