"""Microwave-region radiative transfer in the atmosphere.

A radiative transfer model, stripped to the bare minimum, written only with the
scientific Python stack and with exact differentiation. Provided is code
generation for fast absorption predictors from refractivity models.

Module-wide conventions:
- Temperatures input into refractivity models as reciprocal temperature
  Î¸ = 300/T.
- Individual model components output refractivity N = n - 1, where n is
  refractive index. Use mwrt.fapgen.as_absorption to obtain absorption
  coefficients.
